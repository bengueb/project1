# Project 1

**Project Title:** Brew Me

**Team Members:**
  * Elsa Bengu
  * Juan Carlos Lenz
  * Matthew Kiyoi

**Project Description**
Our application is going to take inputs such a s a brewery name, location (potentially geo-location) or a picture to return results of breweries in your general area.  The results that are returned will give you local breweries, thier location and information about them such as  beers offered. This is scalable because it can be applied to other areas across the country or to other kinds of beverages such as coffee, teas, etc.  As a bonus we are attempting to add a feature where you can upload a picture and bassed off the image it will return to you places where that item is located, the place and location featured, etc.
